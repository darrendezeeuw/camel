# CAMEL

The CAMEL framework is an integrated and flexible framework allowing users to seamlessly compare space weather and space science model outputs with observational data sets.  CAMEL was developed at [Community Coordinated Modeling Center](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov) at NASA GSFC. 

The CAMEL web application can be viewed at: https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/tools/CAMEL/

This repository currently only includes skill score part of CAMEL and does not include the web application and user interface.

Example python notebooks will soon be available. Bla bal
